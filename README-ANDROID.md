# Android APK Build Status

## Current Status
- ✅ Build script created: `build-android.sh`
- ✅ Static files directory: `server/public/`
- ✅ Placeholder APK: `server/public/app-debug.apk`
- ✅ Render configuration updated

## Next Steps for Production APK

1. **Set up Android SDK on Render:**
   - Add ANDROID_HOME environment variable
   - Install Android SDK in build process

2. **Or use GitHub Actions:**
   - Set up Android build in CI/CD
   - Deploy APK to server/public/

3. **Current Workaround:**
   - Placeholder APK resolves cache issues
   - Real APK can be built and uploaded manually

## Files Changed
- `render.yaml` - updated build command
- `build-android.sh` - Android build script
- `server/public/` - static files location

The main issue of APK caching should now be resolved.
